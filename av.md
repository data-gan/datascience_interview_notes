How to reduce size of dataset?
* To reduce dimensionality, we can separate the numerical and categorical variables and remove the correlated variables. For numerical variables, we’ll use correlation. For categorical variables, we’ll use chi-square test.
* PCA
* Random sampling

what is 68–95–99.7 rule?
In statistics, the 68–95–99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule, is a shorthand used to remember the percentage of values that lie within an interval estimate in a normal distribution: 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the values lie within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean, respectively.

You are given a data set on cancer detection. You’ve build a classification model and achieved an accuracy of 96%. Why shouldn’t you be happy with your model performance? What can you do about it?

Accuracy test total classification. However in cancer, it is important to capture false negatives, so go for sensitivity
Accuracy = all sick and non sick people identified
The precision measures the model's accuracy in classifying a sample as positive.
The recall cares only about how the positive samples are classified
Assign weight to classes so minority classes get larger weight
Anomaly detection

When does time series regression model perform better than decision tree model?
Data is linear than non linear interactions

How to reduce variance?
* Regularization
* Pick top n features

When is Ridge regression(L2) favorable over Lasso regression(L1)?
Small / medium sized effect, use ridge regression. medium / large sized effect, use lasso regression

What are leet code analogy for Random forest and GBM?



When does ensembling fail you?
When ensembled models are correlated
What is KKN algorithm?






What are Type I and II error?
Type I error (false positive): The true fact is that the newborns do not have phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism but we consider they have the disorders according to the data.
Type II error (false negative): The true fact is that the newborns have phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism but we consider they do not have the disorders according to the data.

 What is matrix factorization (e.g. SVD) ?
 what is  ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) ?
